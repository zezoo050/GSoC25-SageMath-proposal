\begin{itemize}
    \item Every phase is tested and documented before proceeding to the next phase.
    \item My availability every week ranges from 20 to 25 hours.
    \item I will have my final exams and some holidays in late May / early June. Although
          this will not affect the project schedule, I will be unavailable on certain
          days.
    \item Full-Time Job Possibility: There is a chance that I could start a full-time job
          around mid-July or August. Regardless of this, I will ensure that the project
          schedule is met and all planned milestones are completed on time.
